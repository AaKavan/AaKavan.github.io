# Hello!
This is my personal website!
I will be adding more about my research interests as time goes on.

# About me
I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona. I've always been interested in space, so I am triple majoring in Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy.
Specifically, my research is about studying high-redshift galaxies using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), using its Infrared Camera, NIRCam.

I'm currently a part of the SAPPHIRES program with Professor Egami
