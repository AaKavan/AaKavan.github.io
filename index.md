Hello! This is my personal website.
I will be adding more about my research interests as time goes on.
This website is still in development, so stay tuned!

## About me

I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona. I've always been interested in space, so I am triple majoring in Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy.

My research focuses on high-redshift galaxies using JWST/NIRCam, where I am currently working on modeling galaxy kinematics.
